Data Scientists SAlaries in Europe: Key Factors


1. Introduction

The demand for data science professionals in Europe has surged due to the increased reliance on data-driven decision-making across industries. This analysis aims to uncover key factors affecting data scientist salaries, providing insight for both job seekers and employers.

Objective: To identify patterns and characteristics that influence salaries, allowing for a deeper understanding of the factors that determine compensation levels.


2. Data Overview

Source: Data was obtained from the "Data Science Salaries Dataset" on Kaggle, encompassing 14,838 records from 2020 to 2024.

Key Variables:

Experience Level: (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Expert)
Job Title: Specific roles within data science.
Salary in USD: Standardized salary figures.
Remote Work Ratio: Percentage of work done remotely.
Company Size: Classified by number of employees and revenue.

Added Variables for Analysis:

Job Category: Roles grouped into four categories (Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Architect/Engineer, Data Manager).
Salary in Euro: Standardized salaries for analysis within Europe.
Employee Residence Region: Categorized by European zones.


3. Data Preprocessing

Data Quality: No missing or duplicate data.
Transformations: New variables, such as "job_category" and "salary_in_euro," were added to enable easier analysis.
Filtering: Analysis is focused on data scientists residing in Europe only.


4. Univariate Analysis

Salary Trend (2020-2024): Salaries generally increased until 2023, with a noticeable change in 2024.
Job Distribution: The UK leads in the number of data science professionals and companies hiring in Europe.
Experience Level and Job Category: These variables are evenly distributed and play a crucial role in determining salary levels.
Remote Work: On-site roles remain more common than remote options.
Company Size: Majority of employers (80.58%) are medium-sized companies, highlighting that mid-sized organizations drive much of the demand.


5. Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Influential Factors:
Location: Data scientists in the UK and Western Europe earn higher salaries than those in other regions.
Job Category and Experience Level: Senior roles, particularly in Data Architecture/Engineering, command higher salaries. Notably, while experience generally correlates with higher salaries, data analysts do not see as strong an increase due to limited senior roles within that category.


6. Challenges

Analyzing categorical data proved challenging, as traditional correlation metrics were less effective. Most correlations were visualized through histograms and bar charts, with some nominal variables grouped into broader categories to reveal clearer patterns.


7. Conclusions

For data science professionals, developing technical skills in fields like AI and cloud computing, and potentially relocating to high-paying regions, can improve salary outcomes. Employers should consider both the technical expertise and experience level of candidates and offer competitive salaries to attract and retain talent.
